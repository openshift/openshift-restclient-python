**resources** | [**V1ResourceRequirements**](V1ResourceRequirements.md) | resources computes resource requirements to execute the build. | [optional] 
**revision** | [**V1SourceRevision**](V1SourceRevision.md) | revision is the information from the source for a specific repo snapshot. This is optional. | [optional] 
**run_policy** | **str** | RunPolicy describes how the new build created from this build configuration will be scheduled for execution. This is optional, if not specified we default to \&quot;Serial\&quot;. | [optional]

**strategy** | [**V1BuildStrategy**](V1BuildStrategy.md) | strategy defines how to perform a build. | 
**successful_builds_history_limit** | **int** | successfulBuildsHistoryLimit is the number of old successful builds to retain. If not specified, all successful builds are retained. | [optional] 
**triggers** | [**list[V1BuildTriggerPolicy]**](V1BuildTriggerPolicy.md) | triggers determine how new Builds can be launched from a BuildConfig. If no triggers are defined, a new build can only occur as a result of an explicit openshift.client build creation. |
