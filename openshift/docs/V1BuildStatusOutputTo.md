**image_digest** | **str** | imageDigest is the digest of the built Docker image. The digest uniquely identifies the image in the registry to which it was pushed.  Please note that this field may not always be set even if the push completes successfully - e.g. when the registry returns no digest or returns it in a format that the builder doesn&#39;t understand. | [optional]
