# OpenShift python client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openshift/openshift-restclient-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openshift/openshift-restclient-python)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/openshift/openshift-restclient-python/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/openshift/openshift-restclient-python?branch=master)

Python client for the [OpenShift](http://openshift.redhat.com/) API.

## Installation

From source:

```
git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-python.git
cd openshift-restclient-python
python setup.py install
```

From [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/openshift/) directly:

```
pip install openshift
```

## Usage and examples

The OpenShift client depends on the [Kubernetes Python client](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/client-python.git), and as part of the installation process, the Kubernetes (K8s) client is automatically installed.

To work with a K8s object, use the K8s client, and to work with an OpenShift specific object, use the OpenShift client. For example, the following uses the K8s client to create a new Service object:

```python
import yaml
from kubernetes import client, config

config.load_kube_config()
api = client.CoreV1Api()

service = """
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: MyApp
ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 9376
"""

service_data = yaml.load(service)
resp = api.create_namespaced_service(body=service_data, namespace='default')

# resp is a V1Service object
print resp.metadata.self_link
```

Now in the following example, we use the OpenShift client to create a Route object, and associate it with the new Service:

```python
import yaml
from openshift import client, config

config.load_kube_config()
api = client.OapiApi()

route = """
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: my-service
"""

route_data = yaml.load(route)
resp = api.create_namespaced_route(body=route_data, namespace='default')

# resp is a V1Route object
print resp.metadata.self_link
```

And finally, the following uses the OpenShift client to list Projects the user can access:

```python
from openshift import client, config

config.load_kube_config()
oapi = client.OapiApi()

project_list = oapi.list_project()
for project in project_list.items:
    print project.metadata.name
```

## Documentation

All OpenShift API and Model documentation can be found in the [Generated client's README file](openshift/README.md)

## Community, Support, Discussion

If you have any problem with the package or any suggestions, please file an [issue](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-python/issues).

### Code of Conduct

Participation in the Kubernetes community is governed by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Update generated client
Updating the generated client requires the following tools:

- tox
- maven3

To apply the updates:

1) Incorporate new changes to update scripts 
    - [scripts/constants.py](./scripts/constants.py), [scripts/pom.xml](./scripts/pom.xml), [scripts/preprocess_spec.py](./scripts/preprocess_spec.py), and [update-client.sh](./update-client.sh) are the most important
2) Run tox -e update_client

## Ansible Modules

This repo is home to the tools used to generate the K8s modules for Ansible.

### Using the modules

The modules are currently in pre-release. For convenience there is an Ansible role available at [ansible/ansible-kubernetes-modules](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-kubernetes-modules), which if referenced in a playbook, will provide full access to the latest.

#### Requirements

- Ansible installed [from source](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#running-from-source)
- OpenShift Rest Client installed on the host where the modules will execute

#### Installation and use

Using the Galaxy client, download and install the role as follows:

```
$ ansible-galaxy install ansible.kubernetes-modules
```

Include the role in your playbook, and the modules will be available, allowing tasks from any other play or role to reference them. Here's an example:

```
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no
  roles:
    - role: ansible.kubernetes-modules
    - role: hello-world
```

The `hello-world` role deploys an application to a locally running OpenShift instance by executing tasks with the modules. It's able to access them because `ansible.ansible-kubernetes-modules` is referenced.  

You'll find the modules in the [library](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-kubernetes-modules/tree/master/library) folder of the role. Each contains documented parameters, and the returned data structure. Not every module contains examples, only those where we have added [test data](./openshift/ansiblegen/examples).

If you find a bug, or have a suggestion, related to the modules, please [file an issue here](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-python/issues) 

### Generating the modules

After installing the OpenShift client, the modules can be generated by running the following:

```
$ openshift-ansible-gen modules --output-path /path/to/modules/dir
```

If `--output-path` is not provided, modules will be written to `./_modules`.

### Common module

Individual modules are generated using the OpenShift Rest Client. However, there is a shared or utility module in the [Ansible repo](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) called, *k8s_common.py*, which imports the client, and performs most of the work. This is currently in a pre-release state as well, and is only available in the `devel` branch of Ansible. For this reason, you'll need to run Ansible from source. For assistnace, see [Running from source](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#running-from-source).
